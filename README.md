# FEMA Data Pipeline: Full Detailed Explanation

## 1. Extracting the Data

> **Goal:** Connect to FEMAâ€™s Open Data API and download project information.

**How it works:**
- **FEMA's API** is an open server that allows external programs to request and retrieve public datasets (such as records of funded projects).
- Using Python's `requests` library:
  - You make an HTTP `GET` request to the FEMA API endpoint.
  - The server responds with **raw data**, usually in **JSON format**.

- **What you receive**: A structured dictionary or list of dictionaries â€” each representing a FEMA project (e.g., project ID, funding amount, disaster type, date).

**Important Points:**
- **Error Handling**: Always check if the response was successful (`response.status_code == 200`).
- **Pagination**: If FEMA API sends large datasets, you might need to handle **multiple pages** of data (loop through "next" links).
- **Authentication**: FEMA's basic open APIs may not need tokens, but if required, you could add headers.

## 2. **Transforming the Data**

> **Goal:** Clean and restructure the raw data so itâ€™s usable and trustworthy for analysis.

**Steps involved:**

- **Cleaning**:
  - Remove irrelevant or corrupted records.
  - Drop duplicates if needed.
  - Normalize inconsistent text entries (like disaster names in upper/lowercase).

- **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Fill in missing fields where possible.
  - Remove rows with too many missing critical fields (like no project ID or no funding amount).

- **Data Type Conversion**:
  - Convert numeric fields (e.g., `obligatedAmount`) to `float`.
  - Parse date fields into `datetime` format for easy filtering and sorting.
  - Standardize categorical fields.

**Result:** A **structured**, **analyzable** dataset, clean and standardized, ready for storage.

## 3. **Loading the Data**

> **Goal:** Save the cleaned, structured data into a durable, queryable storage system (PostgreSQL).

**How it works:**

- **Database Connection**:
  - You connect to your PostgreSQL database (e.g., using Python's `psycopg2` or SQLAlchemy library).
  
- **Table Design**:
  - Create tables that match the structure of your data.
  - Example fields: `project_id`, `state`, `county`, `declaration_date`, `obligated_amount`, etc.

- **Insert Data**:
  - Load the cleaned DataFrame into the database table.
  - You can do **batch inserts** for large datasets to make loading faster.


- **Considerations**:
  - Use indexes on important fields (like `project_id`) for faster queries.
  - Ensure data types in PostgreSQL match your transformed types in Python.

**Result:**  
- Your clean FEMA projects data now lives securely in a relational database.
- It is ready to be queried, analyzed, and visualized!

## 4. **DevOps & Deployment**

> **Goal:** Automate the process so itâ€™s reliable, repeatable, and scalable.

**Sub-steps**:

### a. **Source Code Management â€” GitHub**

- All your Python scripts, Dockerfiles, Terraform templates, and Airflow DAGs are stored in a version-controlled GitHub repository.

---

### b. **CI/CD Automation â€” GitHub Actions**

- **Continuous Integration**: 
  - Every time you push changes, GitHub Actions automatically builds and tests your code.
- **Continuous Deployment**:
  - After testing, new containers or scripts can be deployed automatically.
  
---

### c. **Containerization â€” Docker**

- Python apps are packaged inside **Docker containers**:
  - Makes them portable across environments.
  - Reduces "it works on my machine" problems.
  

- Docker images are pushed to **Docker Hub**.

---

### d. **Infrastructure as Code â€” Terraform**

- Instead of manually clicking buttons in Azure, Terraform **provisions resources automatically**.
- You define cloud infrastructure (Azure Data Lake, PostgreSQL Server, Storage Containers) in code.
- Reproducible, consistent, and scalable deployments.

Terraform Example:
```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestorage"
  resource_group_name      = "example-resources"
  location                 = "East US"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}
```

## 5. **Visualization â€” Power BI**

> **Goal:** Create live dashboards and reports to monitor and analyze FEMA project funding.

- Power BI **connects** directly to the PostgreSQL database.
- You create **visual reports**:
  - Funding by State
  - Funding by Disaster Type
  - Time trends of Obligated Amounts
- Reports update automatically as new data flows into PostgreSQL.
